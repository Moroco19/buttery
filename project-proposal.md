## Proposal

Managing groceries is hard.  Finding out what you need, making a list, finding the best deals at your local supermarket, 
and making sure you don’t forget to buy something you need.  Our grocery tracker app is here to help users make efficient 
use of their trips to the grocery store and let them know when they need to restock an item in their pantry.

### What is your project?

We will be building an app with REACT frontend that tracks the groceries an user has in the pantry
or needs to refill based on estimated consumption times (added by user).

### Wireframes!

### User Stories

  1.  As a user, I can know what groceries I need to buy in my next trip to the grocery store.
  2.  As a user, I can enter the groceries that I want to keep track of.
  3.  As a user, I can enter how often I’d like to buy a item I keep track of.
  4.  As a user, I can enter when I’ve purchased an item.
  5.  [Stretch Goal] As a user, I can know where I should go to get the best deal on an item I need.
  6.  [Stretch Goal] As a user, I can get recipe suggestions based on the items I am tracking in my pantry.
